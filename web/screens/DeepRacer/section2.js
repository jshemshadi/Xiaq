        <p>
          AWS DeepRacer gives you an interesting and fun way to get started with
          reinforcement learning (RL). RL is an advanced machine learning (ML)
          technique that takes a very different approach to training models than
          other machine learning methods. Its super power is that it learns very
          complex behaviors without requiring any labeled training data, and can
          make short term decisions while optimizing for a longer term goal.
